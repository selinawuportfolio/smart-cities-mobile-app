<h2>💡 What’s the Big Idea?</h2>

<p>
  CiviSight is built around a simple idea:
  <strong>anyone should be able to report a local issue in seconds and immediately see it reflected on a shared map.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Whether it’s a pothole, a broken streetlight, or a downed power line, reporting shouldn’t require knowing the right
  department or hoping your message doesn’t disappear. CiviSight removes that friction by making issue reporting fast,
  visible, and structured.
</p>

<h2>🚨 What You Can Do</h2>

<h3>📍 File a Complaint</h3>
<p>
  The home screen features a clear <strong>“Report a Complaint”</strong> button that takes you straight to a short,
  intuitive form.
</p>

<h3>📝 Add the Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the issue in your own words</li>
  <li>Set urgency (e.g., <strong>Very Urgent</strong> for safety hazards)</li>
  <li>Select the date and time the issue was observed</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧭 See Your History</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>Profile</strong> tab keeps a running list of all complaints you’ve submitted, making it easy to track
  what you’ve reported over time.
</p>

<h3>🗺️ Check the Map</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>Dashboard</strong> displays all reported issues as pins on a map, giving a shared, real-time view of what’s
  happening across the community.
</p>

<h2>🚧 What’s Next</h2>

<p>This is an early version, and there’s plenty more to build. Planned and in-progress ideas include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>📸 Uploading photos with complaints</li>
  <li>💬 Adding comment threads to each report</li>
  <li>📍 Tapping a map pin to open a full-detail bottom sheet (currently being mocked)</li>
  <li>🔄 Improved status tracking and updates</li>
</ul>
